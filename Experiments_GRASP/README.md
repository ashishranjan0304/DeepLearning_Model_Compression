# GraSP: Gradient Signal Preservation

## Overview

GraSP (Gradient Signal Preservation) is a pruning method that focuses on preserving the gradient flow in the network. By maintaining the gradient signal, GraSP ensures that the network can still learn effectively even after pruning.

## Main Points

1. **Gradient Preservation**: GraSP aims to preserve the gradient signal, which is crucial for effective learning in neural networks.
2. **Pruning Strategy**: The method prunes connections that least affect the gradient signal, ensuring that the remaining connections are essential for learning.
3. **Performance**: GraSP has shown to maintain or even improve model performance by preserving the learning capability of the pruned network.

## Limitations

- **Computation Complexity**: The method involves computing the gradient signal for each connection, which can be computationally intensive.
- **Pruning Granularity**: GraSP operates at the connection level, which may not always align with higher-level structural optimizations.

## Conclusion

GraSP is an effective pruning method that focuses on preserving the gradient signal in neural networks. By retaining essential connections for learning, it ensures the pruned network can still achieve high performance, making it suitable for various models and applications.
